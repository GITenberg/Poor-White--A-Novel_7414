description: '"In a small town in Ohio, a dreamy, rather stupid ''poor white'' boy
  suddenly becomes a rich and famous inventor. This classic novel of Americana, first
  published in 1920, tells the story of the power unleashed by that happenstance--
  a force that overnight dotted a vast valley with cities, built a network of industry,
  made quick men rich and fearful men poor. In telling of the ''poor white''s'' love,
  it shows how the forces that twist men made the boy''s story a wild and terrible
  one, bigger than the mere story of one person."--Page 4 of cover.'
